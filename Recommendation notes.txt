Q1. How would a future application obtain the load balancerâ€™s DNS name if it wanted to use this service?

DNS name is provided as a variable while creating the route 53 'A' record. It is also obtained from the output variable "${aws_alb.main_alb.dns_name}" after executing the terrform apply.  

Q2. What aspects need to be considered to make the code work in a CD pipeline (how does it successfully and safely get into production)?

A Jenkins pipeline can be created for each of the above steps and the infrastructure can be provisioned.All the code will be stored in github for version control and code migration to Developement, UAT and Production. Password should be stored in secret vault and should not be exposed in the terminal or any logs while creating the infrastructure. Authentication process can be run in side car to reduce the load in application container.
